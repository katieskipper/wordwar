# The Wordwar Game!

This is a small OS X command line game written in Ruby. The goal is to complete ten words that start with a semi-random prefix. 

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:katieskipper/wordwar.git
cd wordwar
```

## Play the Game

#### Begin Game

Run the following:

`ruby wordwar.rb`

#### Example Game

```
~/code/wordwar(master âœ“) ruby wordwar.rb 

Play by completing ten words with the prefixes given.
For example, if you see 'ca' you could make a word like 'cat.'
push
:)
sip
:)
pummel
:)
tr
:(
rip
:)
slag
:)
shamshamas
:(
rig
:)
marry
:)
morning
:)
You have made 8 words out of ten.
```

## Is it any good?

No. It uses OSX's dictionary file found in /usr/share/dict/words, which is incomplete. TODO: I need to add top scores.
