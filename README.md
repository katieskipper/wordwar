# The Wordwar Game!

This is a small OS X command line game written in Ruby. The goal is to complete ten words that start with a semi-random prefix. 

## Installation

Clone this repo.

## Play the Game

#### Begin Game

Change directory into the cloned repo and run the following:

`ruby wordwar.rb`

#### Example Game

```
~/code/wordwar(master âœ“) ruby wordwar.rb 

Play by completing ten words with the prefixes given.
For example, if you see 'ca' you could make a word like 'cat.'

sip

pummel

tr

rip

slag

shamshamas

rig

marry
:)
morning
:)
You have made 8 words out of ten.
```

## Is it any good?

No. It uses OSX's dictionary file found in /usr/share/dict/words, which is incomplete. TODO: I need to add top scores.
